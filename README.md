# first_WPF_App
My first play with .NET WPF

## What is it?
Having made a very basic app with *WIN32* (windows.h) in *C++*, I wanted to compare how much easier it was in c# and WPF. There was a BIG difference, 
very little coding required. 

The app is essentially identical, calculating paddle length from basic user input.
